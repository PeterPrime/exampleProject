a Version Control System (VCS) tracks the history of changes on projects

Git: Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
      - don't need a conntection to a central repository unlike centralized version control systems
      - repositories are self-contained units 
      
repository (git project): is a collection of files and folders associated with a project

git clone: creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely
git merge: merges lines of development toghether, used to combine changes made on two different branches

GitHub flow:
    - create a branch: topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually master)
    - add commits: snappshot of the current state of the branch
    - open a pull request: 
    - discuss and review code: commenting, testing and reviewing open pull requests
    - merge: equivalent to a local 'git merge' operation 
    - deploy:
